## Description 
```
I built an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. 

The full video showing functionality of the appliication can be accesed via this link:
